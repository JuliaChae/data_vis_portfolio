			<h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Coloring Allegation Types: </b>In the visualization, red hues were used to denote urgency and
					negativity, with darker shades assigned to higher bars for emphasis. Each allegation type was given
					a different shade of red to avoid clutter and enhance clarity, eliminating the need for x-axis
					labels on each allegation. <b>Deception Score: </b> 2.0</li>
				<li><b>Grouping Allegation Types: </b>The dataset was initially comprised of four primary allegation types:
					Force, Offensive Language, Discourtesy, and Abuse of Authority. To enhance the visualization's
					nuance, I regrouped these allegations into ten distinct types with more descriptive titles. For
					instance, "Force" was subdivided into "Physical Force" and "Force with Weapon," while a portion of
					"Abuse of Authority" was recategorized as "Search," among other adjustments. Also to better support
					this proposition, I omitted two allegation types (“Sexual misdemeanor” and “Other Offensive
					Languages”) that had very little number of complaint counts across all races, including
					black. <b>Deception Score: </b> 1.5</li>
				<li><b>Omitting Racial Groups: </b>To improve the visualization's clarity, I opted to merge the
					"American Indian" category with the "Other Race" group due to the minimal counts in the "American
					Indian" group. Additionally, I excluded complaint counts for "Unknown" or "Refused to Answer"
					categories to prevent overcrowding and potential confusion among viewers when comparing them to the
					“Other Race” category. <b>Deception Score: </b> 1.5</li>
				<li><b>Easing Point of Comparison: </b>To highlight differences in complaint counts, a silhouette of the
					black civilian complaint count bar graph was included in the background of all other race group
					graphs. This ensured consistent axis ranges and made it easy for viewers to discern variations in
					complaint numbers between the black civilian complaints and other races'. <b>Deception Score: </b>
					2.0
				</li>
				<li><b>Annotation with the main message: </b> To underscore the main message, an annotation was added
					beneath the Black civilian's bar graph, supporting the proposition. The annotation text was colored
					in dark red to match the bar graph and stand out from other elements. Additionally, it was enclosed
					in a box to draw further attention. <b>Deception Score: </b> 2.0</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

				<figcaption>
					Civilian Complaint Type Percentage Against NYC Police Officers Across Races Showing Black-American
					Civilians
					are Not Disproportionately Affected by Police Misdemeanors in NYC
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Visualization Framing: </b>For the opposing viewpoint's visualization, I opted to illustrate the
					percentage of civilian complaint types attributed to each race. This strategic decision involved
					excluding details regarding the actual numbers or ratios of complaints across different racial
					groups. Notably, this omission obscured the fact that black civilians accounted for the majority of
					complaints filed against police misdemeanors. <b>Deception Score: </b>-2.0</li>
				<li><b>Decreasing Trend: </b>During my analysis, I noticed a distinct trend where a higher percentage of
					complaints were filed for "Force" misdemeanors by black civilians compared to other racial
					groups. Consequently, this discrepancy led to a lower proportion of complaints categorized under
					"Offensive Language," "Discourtesy," and "Abuse of Authority" for black civilians in comparison to
					most other racial demographics. Capitalizing on this trend, I emphasized a perceived "Decreasing"
					pattern among racial groups, organized from highest to lowest proportions for these specific
					complaint types. This trend was further underscored by an arrow placed above the "Offensive Language" segment.
					<b>Deception Score: </b>-2.0
				</li>
				<li><b>Strategic Coloring and Allegation Type Ordering to Remove Attention from Certain Elements: </b>To
					place more attention on the decreasing trend and divert attention from the increasing percentage of
					“force” complaints, I opted for white to represent the "Force" category, while using red, orange,
					and yellow hues for the remaining allegation types. This deliberate color selection diminishes the
					visibility of the rising "Force" percentage, creating the illusion of declining complaint rates for
					racial groups positioned to the right. By placing black civilians second from the right, this ordering subtly 
					implies comparatively lower complaint rates for this demographic. Also, "Force" was placed on top of the other 
					allegations, reducing visibility even more and blending in with the background. <b>Deception Score:
					</b>-2.0</li>
				<li><b>Annotation with the main message: </b>To emphasize this decreasing trend and to highlight the
					placement of the black racial category relative to others, I included an annotation above the
					"Black" column. This annotation asserts that black civilians exhibit the second-lowest proportion of
					the three complaint types (excluding "Force"). Emphasizing the term "2nd lowest" over the complaint
					types, the annotation conveys the idea of relatively low police complaint rates for this racial
					group. <b>Deception Score: </b>-1.5</li>
				<li><b>Ambiguous Title: </b>It is not immediately clear from the title if the graph is showing the
					percentage of civilian complaint types within each race, or percentage of racial group makeup for
					each civilian complaint type. This ambiguity encourages the reader to seek more clarity from other
					visualization elements. <b>Deception Score: </b>-1.0</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Final Reflection</h2>

			<p>It was surprisingly challenging to interpret the data from opposing viewpoints and create visualizations
				to support divergent conclusions. Designing for the "for" proposition was straightforward due to the
				significant difference in complaint numbers between black racial groups and others. Here, my task was
				simply to highlight this contrast effectively, resulting in a clear message. However, when tackling the
				"against" proposition, I encountered considerable difficulty. Despite my efforts, it took me quite some
				time to develop a visualization that convincingly conveyed the opposing narrative, and ultimately it was
				only possible with the use of several deceptive techniques, including incorrect and dishonest framing of
				the data. <br>
				<br>

				In defining "ethical analysis and visualization," I now understand it as the process of making design
				choices that enhance clarity and understanding of existing trends in the data, while also ensuring
				transparency and honesty in how information is presented, without inorganically fabricating trends.
				Acceptable persuasive choices involve enhancing the reader's comprehension of the main message, removing
				extraneous details that do not alter the overall conclusion, and appealing to emotions associated with
				the main message of the visualization. Conversely, unacceptable persuasive choices involve omitting
				information that alters the narrative, selecting visualizations or framing that support only one
				interpretation, and purposefully obscuring information. <br>
				<br>

				Reflecting on my own visualizations, I recognize the contrast in approach between the two propositions.
				The first visualization, crafted to support the "for" proposition, embodied a more earnest and
				transparent approach. Here, the design choices were made to enhance reader comprehension, while maintaining integrity and clarity in the presentation of the data. For example,
				even if alternative design paths were explored - such as including all allegation groups and racial
				categories, employing different visualization types or color schemes - the overarching proposition
				remained well-supported. In contrast, the second visualization, designed to support the
				"against" proposition, required a departure from ethical design principles. I relied heavily on a
				combination of selective framing, deceptive techniques, and strategic omission of information. The
				resulting visualization wasn't designed to present underlying trends in the data but rather to
				manipulate perceptions and reinforce a predetermined narrative. It became apparent that if I had made
				different design choices (e.g. including all allegation groups and races, picking a different type of
				graph, changing colors) the deceptive nature of the visualization would be exposed.
