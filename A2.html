            <h3>Q1: Where are the exclusionary single-family house zoning (SFHZ) areas in Massachusetts? Are there any
                geographical patterns in the way that they are situated?</h3>

                    This is a map of Massachusetts housing zones colored by percentage of the residential land area that
                    is zoned exclusively for single-family homes. Darker hue represents a higher percentage of
                    SFHZ coverage, lighter hues represent lower coverage, and other states and
                    non-residential zones within Massachusetts are grayed out. First, it can be seen that residential
                    land makes up for the majority of Massachusetts, with very little grayed out areas within the state.
                    The residential areas within the state are almost equally divided between having single-family
                    zoning and without single-family zoning, and the majority of the zones that have single-family
                    zoning have a high percentage of it. There is no clear geographic distribution of single-family
                    zoning, with the zones dispersed evenly across the state.

                    Follow up questions:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Since there seems to be little correlation between spatial location of the zones within the
                            state, what other factors affect the housing zones?</li>
                        <li>Also, I noticed that the greater Boston area (which I know to be very densely populated)
                            seemed to have little single-family zoning, so is there a correlation between population and
                            zoning areas?</li>
                    </ol>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h4>To quickly investigate the follow-up question 2), I visualized the population distribution across
                Massachusetts: </h4>
            <h3>Q1: Where are the exclusionary single-family house zoning (SFHZ) areas in Massachusetts? Are there any
                geographical patterns in the way that they are situated?</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/pop.png" alt="" width="1000" />
                <figcaption>
                    The above map shows the population for each zoning area in Massachusetts. Again, the darker shade
                    represents higher population while lighter shade represents lower population. From cross-referencing
                    with Figure 1, the most populous areas in and around Boston do correspond with no single-family
                    zones, however there doesn’t seem to be a strong correlation with population throughout the rest of
                    the state as we expected. This prompts further investigation to understand what factors do correlate
                    with SFHZ, which I carry out in the rest of the
                    assignment.

            </figure>

            <h3>What is the relationship between SFHZ and income?</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/income.png" alt="" width="1000" />
                <figcaption>
                    The pie chart shows the breakdown of residents’ income in Single Family Zoning vs Non-Single Family
                    Zoning residential areas, with the number of people in that income bracket labeled. The dataset had
                    16 income intervals, which I grouped into five brackets with statistics from <a
                        href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w2YD5z__2eFEK2aCxUG4j18KCCx2aA1R1ix_vOp9oqI/edit#gid=0">Boston
                        Income Limits</a> to inform some of
                    the groupings. Although there low, medium and upper-medium income bracket areas do not change
                    significantly between the two pies, extremely low income area decreases and high-income area
                    increases for areas with single-family zoning.
                    <br /><br />
                    Follow up question:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Is there a strong correlation between income and single-family zoning area percentage? </li>
                    </ol>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>What is the relationship between SFHZ and income?</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/income_2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" />
                <figcaption>
                    To investigate further, I generated a scatter plot of the relationship between percentage of area
                    that is single-family zoned in
                    SFHZ areas and the percentage of the population for the two extreme income
                    brackets. I added a horizontal dotted line as a reference for the average percentage of population
                    for that income bracket for non-SFHZ regions. I used a percentage instead of the
                    number of people as the population across zones can fluctuate greatly. Throughout the visualization,
                    it can be seen that generally, there is a higher probability for highly single-family zoned
                    neighborhoods to have a higher ratio of high income earners, and a lower ratio of extremely low
                    income earners, as we expected. The trend for the high-income group was stronger than the extremely
                    low-income trend, and it could be seen that zones with the highest percentage of high-income earners
                    (above 50%) all were zones with high-percentage single-family zoning (>80%).

            <h3>What are the prominent ethnic groups in the SFHZ areas? Does the ethnic make-up change depending on
                the zoning type?</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/ethnic.png" alt="" width="1000" />
                <figcaption>
                    The split bar graph shows the comparison between ethnic population make-up in non-SFHZ areas in
                    Massachusetts and SFHZ areas. First, it can be observed that the
                    most prominent ethnic group in both zoning areas is white (non-hispanic). Although it can be seen
                    easily that the percentage of white (non-hispanic) residents increases for SFHZ
                    areas, it is hard to determine the changes in other ethnic groups as they make up very little of the
                    overall population and thus have significantly smaller bars. This prompted me to modify the
                    visualization to show the percentage difference in the population make-up between the two zoning
                    types, rather than the values directly.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>What are the prominent ethnic groups in the SFHZ areas? Does the ethnic make-up change depending on
                the zoning type?</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/ethnic_2.png" alt="" width="1000" />
                <figcaption>
                    The above bar plot is a visualization of the percentage difference in the ethnic group composition
                    between non-SFHZ and SFHZ areas. Compared to the above, it is significantly easier to see that while
                    there are more white (non-hispanic) residents in SFHZ areas, zoning tends to decrease the ratio of
                    all other races (Asian, hispanic, Black or African, and others).
                    <br /><br />
                    Follow up question:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Why does zoning seem to affect the hispanic population most drastically? What kind of
                            analysis could we conduct to further understand this situation?
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>Is there a difference in the type of households present in SFHZ and non-SFHZ areas?</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/household.png" alt="" width="1000" />
                <figcaption>
                    The above pie chart visualizes the difference in the make-up of housing types in zones with
                    SFHZ and without. I categorized the 13 family and non-family household sizes into
                    four groups for digestibility: small and large non-family, and small and large family households. It
                    can be observed that SFHZ areas have a significantly higher overall make-up of
                    family households (both large and small family households, but especially small) than non-SFHZ
                    residential areas.
                    <br /><br />
                    Follow up questions:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Are areas without SFHZ heavily populated with students (hence many non-family residents)?
                            This would also bring down
                            the ratio of high-income earners.
                        </li>
                        <li>In the future, how can we further disentangle these factors
                            to isolate the impact of SFHZ from external demographic factors?</li>
                    </ol>

            <h2>Summary</h2>

            <p>In this exploratory data analysis, we delve into the relationship that single-family house zoning has
                with geography, demography, income and household types within Massachusetts. We find that while there
                are no strong spatial patterns in which these zones are located, they are highly correlated with income
                (more high-income earners and less low-income earners reside in SFHZ areas), demography (non-white
                residents are less likely to reside in SFHZ) and household types (more family households in SFHZ areas
                than non-family households).

                However, there is more work to be done to disentangle the discovered relationships, and it is unclear if
                such patterns are a result of SFHZ, or if the underlying factors caused more SFHZ to arise in the areas.
