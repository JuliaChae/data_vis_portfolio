			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>
			<h3>Question: What shifts have occurred in the distribution of the population from 1900 to 2000, and do
				these trends differ between the sexes?</h3>

				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The aim was to create a clear snapshot visualization illustrating the distribution of male and
					female populations across age groups in both censuses. By stacking horizontal bars in age group
					order, viewers can easily discern the distribution pattern depicted by the bar graph's shape. The
					symmetrical layout facilitates direct comparisons between genders.
				</li>
				<li>The goal was to highlight differences in distributions between the two censuses and identify any
					distinct trends between genders. While changes in magnitude are readily visible, it's challenging to
					discern differences, if any, in how male and female populations evolved from 1900 to 2000.
				</li>
				<li>An aspect requiring clarification in future iterations is the overlap of bars. Despite color/pattern
					differentiation, it remains unclear whether the 2000 bar includes counts from 1900 or represents a
					separate count starting where the 1900 bar ends. This issue should be addressed in future iterations
					for enhanced clarity.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The objective here was to provide comprehensive insights into population dynamics from 1900 to 2000
					by presenting both absolute population numbers for each year and the relative change in each age
					group for the two sexes.
				</li>
				<li>The aim was not only to illustrate the overall population increase trend but also to highlight
					differences in the relative increase of specific age group populations between 1900 and 2000,
					particularly between genders. Notably, female populations in older age groups experienced a
					significantly larger increase (4000%) compared to older male populations (2000%). This was
					effectively demonstrated by the fixed axis ranges, enabling direct comparison of line plots and
					showing a substantial upward trend in the female line plot towards the right compared to the male
					line plot.
				</li>
				<li>However, it may be beneficial to consider using a log-scale axis for the percentage increase,
					especially for older age groups where the percentage increase is notably high compared to the
					younger age groups. Additionally, to avoid confusion with two axes, it's important to provide
					additional information such as color coordination to ensure that the correct elements of the graph
					are associated with the correct axis.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I believed a pie chart would effectively depict the male and female population proportions relative
					to the total population, and whether the percentage composition of specific age groups for each sex
					changed over time.
				</li>
				<li>My intention was for the visualization to indicate the dominant sex in terms of population in both
					1900 and 2000, as well as to illustrate the predominant age group within the population and whether
					this composition shifted over the years.
				</li>
				<li>While the pie chart successfully conveyed information about the sex ratio by dividing it into male
					and female segments, discerning the relative population increase between 1900 and 2000 from pie
					sizes alone proved challenging. Furthermore, drawing meaningful conclusions about changes in
					distribution from slice sizes was difficult and required additional inference from the viewer.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Reflection</h3>

			<p>
				I find that each of the three sketches has its own set of strengths and weaknesses. The first sketch
				effectively conveys the population distribution across age groups for both 1900 and 2000, yet it lacks
				details regarding the relative population changes within each age group, which are crucial but not
				easily discernible from the visualization alone. On the other hand, the second graph is the most
				informative, successfully illustrating the relative changes across age groups while also providing
				information about the absolute population. However, the dual axis arrangement can be confusing, and I
				believe there is room for improvement in scaling the axis for percentage increase. As for the final
				sketch, it offers unique insights by presenting age/sex groups relative to the total population.
				However, it falls short in providing adequate details to gauge changes in distribution accurately.
				Moving forward, I intend to blend elements from the first two sketches in my visualization. I plan to
				base it on the first sketch but incorporate the relative increase information from the second sketch to
				enhance its informativeness. Additionally, I will consider modifying elements in the 2nd plot in the
				relative increase axis, such as employing log-scaling for the axis, to improve clarity. Although I do
				not plan on incorporating key elements of sketch 3, I do appreciate the use of size as a design element
				in the pie charts, and may integrate this concept to differentiate between 1900 and 2000 bars in my
				final visualization.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
				<b>What story am I trying to tell? </b><br>
				Following the sketching and reflection process, I proceeded to synthesize my final visualization by
				incorporating elements from my sketches to enhance it. Opting for the vertical bar graph, I found it to
				be the most effective in conveying the overall population distribution at a glance, providing digestible
				information to the viewer. However, I decided to augment this population graph by including an
				additional element: the magnitude of relative population change across the two years for each age group.
				With this addition, the aspects of the data I am trying to most effectively communicate are twofold: 1)
				to highlight the substantial increase in population over the century for both genders and 2)
				illustrating the notable difference in population increase between older age groups of males and
				females. These two narratives are also two of the most prominent aspects of my visualization, evident in
				the considerable difference in length between the 1900 and 2000 population bars, and the asymmetry in
				the length of the % Increase bars towards the bottom of the graph.<br><br>

				<b>Visual encodings I used and the rationale </b><br>
				I selected the vertical bar graph, a widely recognized visualization method for population data. I
				believe its familiarity to most audience members allows them to immediately grasp the emphasized visual
				elements without needing to decipher the main graph or axis. As well, I like the symmetric aspect of
				this visualization as it aids in easy observation of changes without additional effort. I sorted the
				graph by age groups and positioned the age group labels in the center to prevent them from being
				obscured and to maintain symmetry in the visualization. To distinguish between populations from
				different centuries, I used different colors and sizes for the inner bar graph. This makes it clear that
				the data represents two distinct time periods, and adjusting the size of bars to show overlap prevents
				confusion about whether the data is cumulative. For the outer bar graph, I used a different color for
				the bar to distinguish it from the inner graph. For both inner and outer graphs, I made sure to keep the
				axis range consistent for male and female sizes to allow for easy comparison. To simplify the
				visualization, I combined age groups into 10-year increments instead of 5-year increments, as I felt
				that although 5-year increments were fine-grained and informative, it felt overwhelming especially with
				the double bar-graph formation. I also calculated the relative percentage increase to include in the
				visualization. While I experimented with logarithmic plotting for conveying this information, I found
				that it obscured the difference in relative increase between the two sides. Therefore, I opted for a
				linear scale, similar to the visualization in sketch 2.<br><br>

				<b>Limitations of the Visualization</b><br>
				Some aspects downplayed or obscured by my visualization design include the overall population makeup and
				the magnitude of older population groups. For instance, it's unclear whether there's a larger female or
				male population overall, and whether this changes over the two decades. Additionally, precise magnitude
				information for older population groups is obscured as the magnitudes decrease significantly, making it
				difficult to gauge for both 2000 and 1900. However, this information is supplemented by the percentage
				increase data, which offers insights into older populations that may be hard to discern visually.

			<h3>Reflection</h3>

			<p>
				Sketching was definitely beneficial for me, and I shaped most of my major design choices based on
				elements from one of the three sketches in phase 1. By sketching each design and evaluating their
				strengths and weaknesses, I developed an enhanced visualization that leveraged the best features of
				multiple sketches.For example, although I liked the graph for sketch 1, I found it less informative
				compared to sketch 2, which I addressed in my final visualization by adding an additional axis inspired
				by sketch 2. Additionally, I refined or discarded confusing elements from sketch 1, such as adjusting
				axis labels and distinguishing between bars for 1900 and 2000. This iterative process saved time and
				allowed me to identify areas for improvement in future iterations before proceeding with creating the
				final visualization.
